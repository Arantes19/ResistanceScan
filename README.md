# ResistanceScan
This work aims to develop an application that, by applying a set of algorithms, allows the counting and identification
of electrical resistances present in a video. This application should be able to segment the different resistances 
(and only the resistances), identifying their value (expressing it in ohms) and relative location (which region of 
the image is occupied by each resistance) in each frame of the video.
The video shows: 1x 5600Ω resistor; 1x 220Ω resistor; 2x 1000Ω resistors; 1x 2200Ω resistor; and 1x 10000Ω resistor.

How to compile and run: Just by pressing the compile and run button of visual studio.
